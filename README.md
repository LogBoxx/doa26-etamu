# Problem Statement:
Creating effective means of tracking Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become a prevalent objective in warfare and civil environments

# Objective Statement: 
Develop a hybrid Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) system with synchronized SDR hardware utilizing MUSIC algorithms and LiDAR range-finding 

# Deliverables:
Fully implemented hybrid DoA and range estimation system capable of real-time UAV tracking in azimuth/elevation planes<br>
Publication of experimental results and presentation in the AFRL University Design Challenge
